					<h3>Evelyn & Bobbie</h3>
				</header>
				<p>EB wants to change the way intimate apparel is designed, sized and sold. Using material technology, more explicit grading and new structural approaches, EB strives to create meaningful, human-driven products that solve our customers' everyday needs. I've worn many hats at Evelyn & Bobbie. My projects there have ranged from a scrappy Kinect-based 3D body scanning and analysis system to running a custom 3PL fulfillment server.</p>

					<h3>CONSTRVCT</h3>
				</header>
				<p>A collaboration with Mary Huang, this was my first major foray into e-commerce. I developed an automated 3D sizing, pattern generation and print-ready file preparation system. Together we built a web platform that allowed our customers to visualize their garments in real time 3D in their size and image or graphic pattern.</p>

					<h3>N12</h3>
				</header>
				<p>My first major collaboration with Mary Huang, the N12 was the world's first 3D printed textile system. I developed a circle packing algorithm that responds to load, curvature, coverage and stretch requirements.</p>
