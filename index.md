Formerly the junior partner at an <a target="_blank" href="http://smalldesignfirm.com/">interactive design agency</a>, I also co-founded a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.continuumfashion.com">fashion and technology startup</a>. I was also the CTO of <a target="_blank" href="https://evelynbobbie.com">Evelyn & Bobbie</a>, a technology-focused intimate apparel company. I currently work at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a>. In my spare time I use my knowledge of code and machines to make robots build my furniture.
